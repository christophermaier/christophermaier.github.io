I just heard that [my map-reduce patch][] and my [my GridFS
InputStream patch][] for Congomongo were both committed to the main
Congomongo repository!  This marks my first official open source code
contributions, and hopeuflly not the last.

[my map-reduce patch]: http://github.com/somnium/congomongo/commit/df433fc11ab76c48dcfe8fa77c4bf19227161a92
[my GridFS InputStream patch]: http://github.com/somnium/congomongo/commit/c1e1417cb729eaa8e5642127e1682883e7d5968e
