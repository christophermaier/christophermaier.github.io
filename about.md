My name is Christopher Maier, a software engineer that enjoys building
things from both bytes and atoms.

In the past, I've worked at [Operable](http://operable.io) and
[Chef](https://chef.io). Prior to that, I worked as a bioinformatics
developer, as well as a viral oncology lab technician, both at UNC
Chapel Hill.
